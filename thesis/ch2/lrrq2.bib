	abstract = {VPN adoption has seen steady growth over the past decade due to increased public awareness of privacy and surveillance threats. In response, certain governments are attempting to restrict VPN access by identifying connections using “dual use” DPI technology. To investigate the potential for VPN blocking, we develop mechanisms for accurately fingerprinting connections using OpenVPN, the most popular protocol for commercial VPN services. We identify three fingerprints based on protocol features such as byte pattern, packet size, and server response. Playing the role of an attacker who controls the network, we design a two-phase framework that performs passive fingerprinting and active probing in sequence. We evaluate our framework in partnership with a million-user ISP and find that we identify over 85\% of OpenVPN flows with only negligible false positives, suggesting that OpenVPN-based services can be effectively blocked with little collateral damage. Although some commercial VPNs implement countermeasures to avoid detection, our framework successfully identified connections to 34 out of 41 “obfuscated” VPN configurations. We discuss the implications of the VPN fingerprintability for different threat models and propose short-term defenses. In the longer term, we urge commercial VPN providers to be more transparent about their obfuscation approaches and to adopt more principled detection countermeasures, such as those developed in censorship circumvention research.},

	doi = {10.1109/ASYU62119.2024.10757061},
	abstract = {In recent years, the need for remote device access and management, as well as data exchange from remote devices has increased significantly due to the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and the adoption of home- office model in the industry or remote jobs from overseas. This situation is reshaping the methods of access and control of the devices in industrial environments and highlighting the necessitating a secure and efficient management infrastructure. This study is focused on developing a system aiming to provide a secure and effective remote access to IoT devices connected via an Ethernet port. The primary functions of the proposed system are to offer a platform for uploading software to these devices (PLC, HMI, DCS, etc.), updating existing software, and serving as a data acquisition and monitoring dashboard. This functionality enables system administrators to easily update and maintain the software versions of devices, ensuring they remain continuously up-to-date and secure. At the core of the system is WireGuard, a modern VPN solution with high-security standards and a the low-cost, high- performance Orange Pi Zero development board. The installation of the WireGuard VPN server on the Orange Pi Zero ensures a high level of data security during remote access. For the configuration and management of the wireless network of the developed device, a dashboard on Node-RED is employed. This web-based dashboard provides users the ability to scan real-time WiFi networks at the location of the Orange Pi Zero, connect to the selected network, and configure the necessary settings. The mobile application is developed using the Flutter development environment, and network configuration is performed via the Node-RED User Interface on the mobile device. This study aims to provide a solution to IoT systems in terms of security and manageability, offering valuable insights into optimizing IoT infrastructures using open-source and low-cost technologies. The results serve as an important reference for the development and implementation of further similar systems and aim to contribute to research in this field.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a breakthrough technology that interconnects and empowers numerous smart devices allowing them to communicate, collect, and exchange data. The most challenging issue in IoT networks is securing exchanged data. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have a significant impact on ensuring security within IoT systems. So implementing a VPN-based solution can bring multiple security values to IoT systems, especially for exchanged data. However, most VPN-based solutions rely on a single central server responsible for managing all VPN connections. This presents a major problem when the number of managed VPNs increases because it will lead to the performance deterioration of the VPN server and can even lead to a single point of failure problem. We propose in this paper a distributed VPN-based solution that relies on distributed fog nodes playing the role of VPN servers. To determine the VPN server responsible for a specific communication, a fully decentralized and efficient search is guaranteed within the fog nodes through the utilization of the DHT-based Chord protocol. To enforce security and immutability, blockchain is used to verify the different criteria of a new requester to join a specific VPN. The performance evaluations have shown that our solution is efficient in terms of cost, time, and complexity.},

Traditional virtual private networks (VPNs) generally experience performance, latency, and security issues, especially when supporting secure remote access for Industry 4.0 and e-health applications. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel zero-trust network-access framework for next-generation industrial networks called Secure Transmission (SecT). SecT is a User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based solution, ensuring speed and effectiveness, with role-based access control. It uses a centralized management interface that can adapt to various network environments, providing secure access to mission-critical applications and increasing operational agility. SecT aims to meet the emerging demands of modern industrial networks, offering secure access with improved performance. The results of a comparative analysis show that SecT outperforms traditional VPNs in both capability and flexibility, adapting well to new network conditions.},

This paper proposes an IIOT fleet management architecture based on micro-services and containerized edge devices to target this scenario where a company monitors and exploits data from several distributed industrial assets. Each edge device is managed from a centralized Open Balena server. This server controls and monitors the software distributed to edge devices connected to industrial assets. The edge devices run containerized micro-services to capture, storage, analyze and visualize data. These data are sent to the server, where microservices provide a general view and analyze data from all the monitored assets.

These challenges can be significantly mitigated through data-decentralized direct sender-to-receiver exchanges with a remote 'Agent', which is responsible for connectivity management. This work presents a prototype data-decentralized AIoT platform (DAIoTtalk) featuring peer-to-peer communications empowered by customized gRPC remote procedure calls based on the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) paradigm. An extension of IoTtalk, DAIoTtalk ensures device management with more adaptable node networking and offers a test bed for low-code development with decentralized communications. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our design achieves at least 3 times more efficiency than a data-centralized approach. We also develop a case study to showcase the flexibility of our platform.},

In this framework, DECT replaces BLE to enable secure and efficient device discovery, while Wi-Fi supports high-bandwidth data transmission. Specifically, DECT utilizes its licensed spectrum to establish a secure communication channel for sharing Wi-Fi configuration information, enabling a secure and reliable setup of high-speed Wi-Fi data transmission links between devices. To validate this approach, we implemented the DECT medium access control layer on the Nordic nRF9161-DK platform and evaluated the end-to-end delay between two devices. Our results demonstrate an impressive transmission delay of less than 1 {\textbackslash}mu s for EWDC communication, enabling rapid device discovery and highly efficient operation. Furthermore, to enhance the security of wireless direct connections, the WireGuard, a VPN tunnel, is employed to encrypt data transmission over Wi-Fi providing robust protection for data shared on public frequency bandwidths. The proposed hybrid DECT-2020 NR and Wi-Fi solution significantly improves reliability, security, and communication efficiency, positioning it as a robust candidate for next-generation IoT communication systems.},

	abstract = {Crowd behavior recognition plays a critical role in various domains, including public safety, event management, and urban planning. Understanding crowd dynamics and detecting behaviors based on violence levels are crucial for preventing incidents and maintaining order in crowded environments. However, traditional surveillance methods fall short of providing comprehensive and real-time insights into complex crowd behavior patterns and fail to distinguish different violence levels within crowds that affect proactive decision-making. Moreover, most of the current systems do not provide reliable secure data transmission and are not viable in protecting the privacy of individuals. This paper designs an end-to-end secure and smart surveillance system, namely PublicVision, that transmits CCTV data securely to a remote central hub where a deep learning (DL) model based on Swin Transformer is utilized to identify and analyze crowd behaviors. A novel video dataset was created to train the DL model that identifies crowds based on size and violence level. The proposed system incorporates end-to-end security by creating a Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN) and leverages the property of IP Security (IPSec) and Firewall for confidentiality and integrity during transmission and storage. Experiment analysis and real-time inference using DeepStream Software Development Kit (SDK) proved that the proposed system has significant implications for public safety, security, and crowd management in various contexts, including public spaces, transportation hubs, and large-scale events.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333897},
	abstract = {Fieldbusses have been the backbone of inter-device communication in both industrial and home automation settings for a few decades. The underlying assumption is the availability of reliable and low-latency communication for all busses. This often implies that the busses are confined to a single physical location. With the advent of the `Internet of Things' (IoT) and succinctly the `Industrial Internet of Things' (IIoT) and the increased demand for control logic to be pushed into the `Cloud', that assumption can no longer be upheld. Since no (I)IoT protocol exists to provide remote control, let alone in a secure fashion, while providing low latency at the same time, we are left with the problem of routing fieldbusses from, say, data-centres to shop-floors. This presents a challenge, because those busses have been designed for safety rather than security.In this paper, we elaborate on the viability of routing layer two fieldbus traffic while providing both: low latency to fulfil real-time requirements and security through cryptographic tunnels. We design and implement a network topology where Profinet traffic is routed through a VXLAN over Wireguard overlay to control a SoftPLC instance. We evaluate our implementation in a realistic test-bed and our measurements indicate that bridging Profinet over VXLAN and Wireguard induces a latency low enough for running time-critical applications.},
