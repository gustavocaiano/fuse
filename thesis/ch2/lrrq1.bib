	abstract = {With the introduction of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cyber-physical system (CPS) concepts the industrial automation sector is undergoing enormous change towards highly interconnected and globally distributed automation systems. Following this trend the industry is facing interoperability challenges between devices and systems, which origin in the market and technology fragmentation of the past years. However, established integration techniques from the IoT domain cannot be fully adapted in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) environments due to stricter dependability and real time constraints.Since design patterns offer a practical means to gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain, patterns are applied in this paper to develop a software architecture that is suitable for the deployment in the upcoming IIoT environments. The resulting software architecture combines ideas from the IoT world, industrial automation systems, as well as modern information technology (IT) and cloud architectures. Its lightweight and flexible design, along with the support of state-of-the-art development approaches (containerization, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD)) make the architecture equally suitable for the deployment on cloud, fog and edge devices. All in all, these features facilitate the deployment of services and communication protocols on device level, to enable the transparent and automatic integration of heterogenous devices and protocols, on demand.},

	abstract = {Digital innovation is an important and evolving process that refers to the transformation and integration of digital technologies into various aspects of everyday life and work. In this context, innovative digital solutions are often adopted and developed, including the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to fully understand the potential, trends, and challenges related to the implementation of these technologies in data management, we seek to identify the most promising architectural choices for an IoT infrastructure from the perspective of key aspects in the context of Data Management. In this way, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of IoT systems to guide organizations towards more informed decisions, offering cutting-edge solutions and contributing to digital transformation. This work aims to examine aspects such as Data Collection, Data Aggregation, Data Integration, Data Security, Data Retention, and Data Analysis, with particular attention to emerging challenges in these contexts. Within the context of digital innovation, our study focuses on several areas of interest. For example, in the field of smart cities, we explore how the use of Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing technologies can improve video surveillance and promote the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for better management of smart cities. Cloud computing, characterized by centralized data processing and storage, represents a well established paradigm of IoT infrastructure. Fog computing extends these capabilities to the network edge, bringing computation and data storage closer to the data source, thereby reducing latency and enhancing real-time processing. Edge computing takes this concept further by processing data directly at or near the data source, minimizing the need for data to traverse long distances to centralized hubs, thus enabling even faster response times and improved efficiency. Additionally, we examine how human-centric methods and user modeling tools can facilitate the transition to intelligent environments, such as workplaces, healthcare, and cities. Considering the emerging challenges in IoT data management, our work provides an overview of the solutions offered by Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing, enabling industries and small and medium-sized enterprises to adopt targeted and sustainable digital transformation strategies.},

IoT purpose will only be achieved when the entities present in this network can fully interoperate with each other. However, the heterogeneity of devices, and the contexts in which they are inserted, can create obstacles in terms of interoperability. This paper aims to describe a systematic mapping carried out with the aim of identifying primary studies dealing with interoperability in IoT context. The focus was on the pragmatic interoperability level, since most researches of the works propose solutions to support the technical and semantic interoperability levels. Twelve papers were selected and analyzed aimed of answering the research questions formulated. Few of them addressed pragmatic interoperability support and have explored solutions in the context of IoT.},

	abstract = {In 2020, fifty billion devices will be part of the global computer network. This expectation has raised several discussions and challenges on the heterogeneity of hardware and software on the Internet of Things (IoT). Interoperability is one of the main challenges and it consists of the integration of heterogeneous devices and services. Recently, the Web of Things (WoT) concept emerged as new way to provide IoT services as web resources, which enables the integration of heterogeneous technologies. This paper introduces a multi-protocol strategy for the interoperability of distinct communication protocols (HTTP, MQTT, and CoAP) applied to Web of Things context and it reports a set of experiments with different workloads and evaluation scenarios. The contributions include the performance of the multi-protocol strategy and the bottlenecks analysis of the evaluated protocols. The results show the response time variation when using Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices (Raspberry Pi and ESP8266) and a cloud-based environment and the better performance of CoAP and MQTT in comparison to HTTP.},

	abstract = {Since the Internet of Things will continue to grow in the coming years, the need for services covering several IoT application areas will grow in order to realize the efficiency gains promised by IoT. Cloud computing, in particular, is a technology closely related to the Internet of Things. The synergy between the Cloud and IoT has emerged largely from the attributes of the Cloud that directly benefit IoT and enable its continued growth. The adoption of cloud services by IoT faces new challenges. However, service developers looking to add value to existing IoT systems are faced with very heterogeneous devices and systems. These systems implement a wide variety of network connectivity options, proprietary or standards-based protocols, and communication methods unknown to an innovative IoT service developer. In this paper, the problem of heterogeneity in the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing integration is studied, and some existing solutions are compared.},

For this reason, processes associated with these devices are generating new requirements at the level of interconnectivity, security, and scalability. Due to the large volume of devices, this growth process has tested the existing communications infrastructure, deployment architecture, different support services, technical requirements and the intrinsic characteristics of the services offered. In this sense, the use of Edge Computing schemes and TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking), is proposed as a tool for supporting IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) services to achieve optimization and assurance processes of latency, scalability and interoperability parameters required by critical mission services such as health, transportation and production. In this sense, we propose several strategies for assuring low latency, scalability and interoperability in Edge Computing and TSN networks for critical IIoT services. These strategies are evaluated considering different levels of congestion and considering different schemes such as best effort, TSN and Edge Computing.},

	abstract = {Modern building automation systems enable the comprehensive observation and control of intelligent environments. The Internet of Things has reshaped building automation from closed and physically intertwined to more open and accessible systems. The accompanying emergence of multimedia in buildings such as audio and video through stream-based sensors opens up possibilities for profound and feature-rich applications. However, at present, building automation does not benefit from the inherent information contained in streamed multimedia. The goal of this work is to exploit informational value contained in multimedia in order to integrate stream-based sensors into existing building automation systems. This is accomplished with the introduction of an intermediate layer where complex information, such as multimedia, from different origins is untangled into pieces of information. Then, each piece of information is represented with an unambiguous description and can be consumed by microservices. Finally, a fog-based platform, which orchestrates multiple microservices, is used to provide services for users and automation tasks. To proof the usability of our proposed concept, an evaluation is conducted in a residential environment considering multiple use case scenarios involving streamed video and point cloud data. Solid results show that the system fulfills prior defined security, latency, privacy, extensibility, and scalability requirements.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in Deep Learning, have made possible distributed multi-camera vision analytics targeted at a variety of surveillance applications involving automated real-time analysis of events from multiple video perspectives. However, the latency critical nature of these applications necessitates computing at the Edge of the network, close to the cameras [1] . The required Edge computing infrastructure is necessarily distributed, with cloud like capabilities such as fault tolerance, scalability, multi-application tenancy, and security, while functioning at the unique operating environment of the Edge. Characteristics of the Edge include, highly heterogeneous hardware platforms with limited computational resources, variable latency wireless networks, and minimal physical security. To enable vision analytics at the Edge, application developers need a distributed middleware layer that provides a suitable abstraction of the Edge computing system, allowing cloud like DevOps workflow at the Edge. Middleware layers facilitate application development by providing suitable system abstractions thereby allowing the application programmers to focus on the applications needs rather than system details. In this poster, we present the requirements of such a middleware system. We propose a distributed messaging system with storage capabilities as a potential candidate for the middleware layer.},

	doi = {10.1109/FiCloud.2019.00012},
	abstract = {In the last few years, there has been a rapid proliferation of a wide range of real-time video services and applications. These technologies flood the wireless systems with video content on a daily basis. As a result of this sharp increase in video traffic, the prospect of errors due to network interference and congestion rises. Incidentally, the adoption of the 5th generation of wireless systems (5G) will allow this growth to be even greater due to its high bandwidth capacity and low latency. However, even with these improvements on the wireless capabilities, a reliable and high-quality video transmission still imposes several challenges, such as how to handle a large number of heterogeneous devices and how to better use the resource-richer Edge, Fog, and Cloud computing sources to meet the user's requirements. To overcome these issues, this work proposes a multi-tier video delivery architecture relying upon several technologies such as Multi-access Edge computing (MEC), 5G slices, and microservice placement/chaining. Furthermore, to assess the proposed idea an experimental proof-of-concept testbed of the multi-tier architecture was designed, implemented, and evaluated using real-world tools and actual video sequences. The results obtained supported our claim that a multi-tier video delivery system is feasible and can greatly benefit the end-users.},
