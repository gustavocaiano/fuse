	abstract = {Object detection models have been experiencing significant improvements over the years due to advancements in deep learning techniques, increased availability of large-scale annotated datasets, and computational resources. Different object detection models have varying levels of accuracy, speed, and robustness. With the increasing complexity and diversity of object detection models, it becomes a problem for researchers and practitioners to choose the most suitable model for their specific needs. This research paper outlines the escalating demand for robust comparison of object detection models in response to rapidly advancing technology. This evaluation helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of these models and selecting the most suitable one for a specific task. This highlights a significant challenge stemming from the lack of recent comparative studies on object detection models across various image qualities, object sizes, and training data sizes. The above challenges are tackled by a meticulous evaluation of three state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLO-v8, Faster R-CNN with ResNet 50 and 101 backbones, and End-to-End Object Detection Transformers (DETR) utilizing ResNet 50 and 101 backbones by employing a rigorous assessment framework encompassing mean Average Precision (mAP), accuracy, and inference speed. This study focuses on thoroughly examining how well the models perform across three different datasets: TACO, PlastOPol, and TACO 4.5. These datasets consist of open-world images captured in real-time from various locations. They include 1500, 2500, and 6500 images respectively, depicting real-world environments with varying lighting conditions and complex backgrounds. The results identify YOLOv8 as the superior model for high and medium-quality images, while Faster R-CNN performs better for low-quality images. However, DETR's accuracy falls short compared to other models. The paper fills a crucial gap in understanding model performance across varying image qualities and object sizes and helps in taking informed decisions in object detection systems.}

	abstract = {Modern approaches with advanced technology can automate and expand the extent and resolution of biodiversity monitoring. We present the development of an innovative system for automated wildlife monitoring in a coastal Natura 2000 nature reserve of the Netherlands with 65 wireless 4G wildlife cameras which are deployed autonomously in the field with 12 V/2A solar panels, i.e. without the need to replace batteries or manually retrieve SD cards. The cameras transmit images automatically (through a mobile network) to a sensor portal, which contains a PostgreSQL database and functionalities for automated task scheduling and data management, allowing scientists and site managers via a web interface to view images and remotely monitor sensor performance (e.g. number of uploaded files, battery status and SD card storage of cameras). The camera trap sampling design combines a grid-based sampling stratified by major habitats with the camera placement along a traditional monitoring route, and with an experimental set-up inside and outside large herbivore exclosures. This provides opportunities for studying the distribution, habitat use, activity, phenology, population structure and community composition of wildlife species and allows comparison of traditional with novel monitoring approaches. Images are transferred via application programming interfaces to external services for automated species identification and long-term data storage. A deep learning model for species identification was tested and showed promising results for identifying focal species. Furthermore, a detailed cost analysis revealed that establishment costs of the automated system are higher but the annual operating costs much lower than those for traditional camera trapping, resulting in the automated system being >40 % more cost-efficient. The developed end-to-end data pipeline demonstrates that continuous monitoring with automated wildlife camera networks is feasible and cost-efficient, with multiple benefits for extending the current monitoring methods. The system can be applied in open habitats of other nature reserves with mobile network coverage.}

However, if there are rigorous guidelines for systematic literature reviews in software engineering, the same is not true for mapping reviews. Objective: Develop a set of rigorous guidelines for mapping reviews. Method: The guidelines were based on some orientations for mapping reviews, mapping studies and on adaptations from existent guidelines for systematic literature reviews. Results: A set of guidelines, presented as a method, consisting of six stages. Conclusion: The guidelines form a well structured method for mapping reviews with the potential to attain high-quality reviews.},
